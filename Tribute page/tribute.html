            <p>From the humble beginnings on a farm to his decision for Christ at a local revival on the edge of Charlotte, North Carolina, to his travels around the world speaking in stadiums filled to capacity, Billy Graham has pursued a singular vision—to share the love of Jesus Christ with all who would listen.</p>
            <p>Billy Graham’s message has never changed, and it never will. It is a simple message, but one that comes straight from God’s Word. “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life” (John 3:16, NKJV).</p>
           <p>In over 55 years of ministry, Billy Graham has preached the Gospel message to more than 215 million people in over 185 countries around the world. The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, which he founded in 1950, reaches out to millions more each year through radio and television broadcasts, films, literature, training, events, and the Internet. Whether exhorting a small crowd of teens at a Youth For Christ rally, speaking against apartheid in a stadium in South Africa, or praying for a wounded nation in the aftermath of 9/11, Billy Graham has lived as a man on a mission following hard after God’s calling. The mission has evolved as technology has opened doors to the whole world, but the message of hope in Christ has remained unchanged.
